## Turner Software

Hi, I'm James Turner and I'm the founder and director of Turner Software. We're a small software development company from Adelaide, Australia.

I've been operating Turner Software since 2009. Initially as a contracted website development agency, it has turned into a dedicated .NET development shop.

I build software because I love doing so - it has been a dream of mine to do so before I could even spell software development. The time and dedication I've put into the craft helps ensure high quality software for others to build their ideas upon.
